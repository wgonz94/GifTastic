## What Giftastic Does
* Generates Buttons from ```topics``` array
* Creates new buttons from text input 
* Generates gif images based on selected topic button
* Display still gifs, but toggle motion state when clicked

## Technologies Used

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. jQuery for DOM manipulation
5. AJAX
6. Giphy API
7. Google Fonts

## How it Works

* HTML gives the page its basic structure. CSS and Google Fonts were used to style the page.
* Buttons are dynamically generated by using jQuery, an array, and a for-loop.
* Depending on the button clicked, that will send out an AJAX call using a query to the Giphy API (certain parameters will passed such as the search term, number of responses, and an API key)
* Giphy then gives a JSON object as a response. It is then sent to display in the HTML using jQuery and DOM manipulation.
